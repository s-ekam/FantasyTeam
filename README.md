# FantasyTeam
A project to select fantasy team with max points given a list of players in a CSV.

Input File structure:
 player_type, cost, points
 
Player Type:
 1 -> Wicket Keeper
 2 -> Batsman
 3 -> All Rounder
 4 -> Baller


Sample input file is present in /src/player_info.csv .

I have used NetBeans 12.1 IDE to create this. You can easily import this into Netbeans to run or edit it.
